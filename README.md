- 👋 Hi, I’m Antonio Campos Alegre also known as @Thragull. Thragull was the name of my main World of Warcraft character and I kept it as my online identity.
- 👀 I have a lot of interests. When I was young I always wanted to become an airforce pilot, but unfortunately, when I was 16 years old I had a little problem with my lung that impeeded me to achieve that dream. I then decided to start study Computer System 
  Engineering, but after few years the government changed the university plan and with all the changes they implemented I was feeling forced to restart my university career almost from the very begining. Almost out of nowhere, the oportunity to join aviation,
  knoked to my door once again, but this time as a cabin crew. I started my career in aviation which I'm still performing, but I always kept my interest in computing. So now I have decided to join a Full Stack Development Bootcamp. I want to combine this
  two passions. Since this bootcamp gives me the chance of working in remote, I would like to continue traveling around the glove while I perform my job as a developer. In fact I am right now writing this words from my hotel swimming pool at Dakar. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a Full Stack Development Bootcamp at 4Geeks Academy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Well at this point I'm not looking at any collaboration, but since I work in aviation. I wouldn't mind to collaborate with different Airlines to develop their digital projects. I think as a cabin crew maybe I could add a
  different point of view that could be helpfull in order to approach aviation to the next generations and at the same time to the passengers.
